As far as I can tell:

'Power-Off' assumes the rocket is coasting, "Power-On" assumes the engine is firing. 
I think the only difference is that the latter takes into account the nozzle exit pressure?

CA is axially along the body (i.e. x-direction)
CN is normal to the body (i.e. y or z direction, since it is rotationally symmetric).

CD is parralel to the incoming flow
CL is normal to the incoming flow

I think "CNalpha (0 to 4 deg) (per rad)" is simply

(CN at alpha=4 - CN at alpha=0) / (4 degrees, in radians)

CP (0 to 4 deg) is simply the CP at alpha=4

It uses the largest cross-sectional area to normalise force coefficients.
