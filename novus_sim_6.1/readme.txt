Simulation program for vapour pressure fed nitrous oxide hybrid rocket motors
Joe Hunt

Instructions:
Modify inputs at top of motor_sim.py and run using python 3.
Program outputs file motor_out.csv. This is used as an input to trajectory_sim.py.


Other dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib

Files:

motor_sim.py				simulation program for motor
motor_out.csv				motor performance output file generated by motor_sim.pt
hybrid.rasp				output .rasp file for RAS aero*
trajectory_sim.py			simuluation program for rocket trajectory
hybrid_functions			contains functions governing motor behaviour and material properties

Additional input data:
atmosphere_data.csv			1976 standard atmosphere
drag_coefficient_data.csv		drag coefficient to mach data (RAS Aero)
L_Nitrous_S_HDPE.propep			propep frozen and shifting outputs for a range of pressures and O/F ratios

*Note that a perennial problem with RASP data is the rate of decrease of mass is always assumed to be proportional
to thrust, which is invalid as a nitrous hybrid's ISP changes with time. Hence further use of this file introduces
error from this approximation.
