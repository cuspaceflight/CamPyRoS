Style pointers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Vaguly follow normal convtions (PEP8)
- Use docstrings on functions, these must be surrounded by `"""` (not `'''`) and should be `google format <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_ (most are numpy but we are transitioning away)
- Comments not for documentation should use `#` (i.e. pointers about what individual code sections do)
- Docstrings are whitespace sensitive 
- Please keep a note in readme or elsewear of papers you have used
