       "Troposphere (MST) Radar at Aberystwyth (UK) is a 46.5 MHz\n",
       "wind-profiling instrument. It transmits short pulses of radio waves\n",
       "which are scattered back to it from atmospheric targets. The distance\n",
       "of a target from the instrument is determined by the time delay\n",
       "between the transmission and reception of a pulse. The main targets\n",
       "are metre-scale refractive index irregularities, which are referred to\n",
       "as clear-air targets (the term does not necessarily imply clear-sky\n",
       "conditions as the radar is able to see through clouds). Hydrometeors,\n",
       "aircraft, and ground-based objects can also give rise to radar\n",
       "returns. The receiver signal is occasionally contaminated by\n",
       "interference. The refractive index irregularities are caused by\n",
       "variations in atmospheric humidity (within the lowest 10 km of the\n",
       "atmosphere), in atmospheric density (within the lowest few 10s of km)\n",
       "and in free electron density (above 50 km). The radar return signal\n",
       "power is typically proportional to the square of the mean vertical\n",
       "gradient of the (potential) refractive index and inversely\n",
       "proportional to the square of the range of the clear-air targets from\n",
       "the radar. The refractive index irregularities are assumed to be\n",
       "advected with the wind. Consequently the radial velocity, i.e. the\n",
       "component of the wind vector along the radar beam pointing direction,\n",
       "can be inferred from the Doppler shift of the radar return\n",
       "signal. Atmospheric turbulence gives rise to variability in the radial\n",
       "velocity when observed over a time scale of a few tens of\n",
       "seconds. However, as a result of the radar's finite beam width, the\n",
       "observed spread tends to be dominated by a beam-broadening component,\n",
       "which is proportional to the horizontal wind speed. Consequently it\n",
       "becomes increasingly difficult to infer turbulence intensities as the\n",
       "wind speed increases.\n",
       "  The radar receiver signal is sampled at 1.0 us intervals following\n",
       "the transmission of a pulse. This corresponds to sampling at 150.0 m\n",
       "intervals in range from the radar. It is necessary to sample both the\n",
       "in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the receiver signal\n",
       "(i.e. complex values) in order to allow both the magnitude and the\n",
       "sign of the Doppler shift to be inferred. In the m-mode samples are\n",
       "recorded between ranges of approximately 60 and 90 km. In the st-mode\n",
       "samples are recorded between ranges of approximately 2 and 20 km. It\n",
       "is possible to operate the radar in mst-mode so that both altitude\n",
       "ranges are sampled simultaneously. The range resolution of the radar\n",
       "returns is determined by the length of the transmitter pulse (not by\n",
       "the sampling interval), to which the receiver bandwidth must be\n",
       "matched. The range resolution can be increased by using complementary\n",
       "coding. This requires the phase of sub-lengths of the transmitter\n",
       "pulse to be offset by either 0 or 180 degrees according to a set\n",
       "coding pattern. The range resolution is then determined by the\n",
       "sub-length of the transmitter pulse (to which the receiver bandwidth\n",
       "is matched).\n",
       "  No attempt is made to derive radar return signal parameters until\n",

       "used to refer to this collection interval or to range profiles of any\n",
       "of the data products associated with it. A dwell initially consists of\n",
       "a complex time series, for each range gate, of I and Q samples which\n",
       "are separated in time by the inter pulse period (of the order of a\n",
       "millisecond). The nature of the samples changes only slowly from pulse\n",
       "to pulse and so coherent integration is applied - for each range gate,\n",
       "groups of consecutive samples are summed together. The number of\n",
       "complex samples in the resulting time series is thus reduced, and the\n",
       "time interval between them is increased, by a factor equal to the\n",
       "number of coherent integrations (typically of the order of a few\n",
       "hundred). The time interval between the new samples (typically of the\n",
       "order of 0.1 s) determines the Nyquist velocity (typically of the\n",
       "order of 10 m/s), the maximum radial velocity that can be\n",
       "unambiguously determined. Decoding must be applied to the coherently\n",
       "integrated samples if a complementary transmitter code has been\n",
       "used. For each range gate, a complex Doppler frequency spectrum is\n",
       "derived by applying a weighting window to the complex time series data\n",
       "followed by a discrete Fourier transform. This spectrum is multiplied\n",
       "by its complex conjugate to give a power spectrum. Doppler frequencies\n",

       "by a positive velocity. If desired, consecutively-observed Doppler\n",

       "(the number depends on the data weighting window used) are typically\n",
       "contaminated by dc biases in the time-series samples. The values must\n",
       "be replaced by linearly interpolating between the PSDs of adjacent\n",
       "velocity bins. The noise power is dominated by broad-band lower-VHF\n",
       "cosmic radiation, which undergoes a diurnal variation by a factor of\n",
       "approximately 2.\n",
       "  For each Doppler velocity power spectrum, the noise power spectral\n",
       "density (PSD) is determined by the statistical method of Hildebrand\n",
       "and Sekhon (1974). The noise power is equal to the noise PSD summed\n",

       "smoothed PSD has dropped below a set fraction of the peak value, or a\n",
       "local minimum is encountered (and the smoothed PSD is below a set\n",
       "fraction of the peak value). The final criterion is particularly\n",
       "important under stratiform precipitation conditions in order to\n",
       "separate partially-overlapping clear-air and hydrometeor signal\n",
       "components. The PSDs within the signal limits first have the noise PSD\n",
       "subtracted and are then compensated for the low-pass-filtering effect\n",
       "of coherent integration. The zeroth (m0), first (m1) and second (m2)\n",
       "order moments (of the corrected PSDs within the signal limits) are\n",
       "calculated in order to derive the signal power (m0), the radial\n",
       "velocity (m1/m0) and the spectral width (sqrt[(m2/m0) -\n",
       "(m1/m0)**2]). For st-mode observations it is desirable to identify\n",
       "more than one signal component per spectrum (typically two). A radial\n",
       "continuity algorithm is then used to identify the primary signal\n",
       "component for each range gate, i.e. that which leads to the most\n",
       "likely overall clear-air radar return profile. A second attempt may be\n",
       "made to identify the primary signal components if the first profile is\n",
       "deemed to be contaminated by interference. A final attempt is made to\n",
       "improve the selection of primary signal components for the lowest\n",
       "range gates in case of contamination by hydrometeor\n",
       "returns. Subsequently attention is confined to the primary signal\n",
       "components. Nevertheless, the radar return parameters for the\n",
       "non-primary signal components are saved in the radial data files as\n",
       "they may contain scientifically useful information, e.g. concerning\n",
       "precipitation.\n",
       "  For wind-profiling purposes, MST radar observations are cycled\n",
       "through a sequence of dwells with different beam pointing\n",
       "directions. The radial velocity for each dwell is assumed to represent\n",
       "the the dot product of the three-dimensional wind vector and a unit\n",
       "vector along the beam pointing direction. The radial velocity observed\n",
       "by a vertical beam (i.e. a dwell with a beam pointing zenith angle of\n",
       "zero) is therefore assumed to be equal to the vertical component of\n",
       "the wind. The radial velocity observed by an off-vertical beam (i.e. a\n",
       "dwell with a small, non-zero beam pointing zenith angle) is assumed to\n",
       "represent the vector sum of the vertical component of the wind\n",
       "multiplied by the cosine of the zenith angle, and the component of the\n",
       "horizontal wind along the the radar beam pointing azimuth multiplied\n",
       "by the sine of the zenith angle. Consequently a component of the\n",

       "algorithm is applied to the horizontal wind components for the\n",

       "vertical beams, as a further test for reliability. Time continuity is\n",
       "first established uni-directionally, i.e. by comparing the\n",

       "wind-profiling instrument. It transmits short pulses of radio waves\n",
       "which are scattered back to it from atmospheric targets. The distance\n",
       "of a target from the instrument is determined by the time delay\n",

       "and in free electron density (above 50 km). The radar return signal\n",
       "power is typically proportional to the square of the mean vertical\n",

       "can be inferred from the Doppler shift of the radar return\n",
       "signal. Atmospheric turbulence gives rise to variability in the radial\n",
       "velocity when observed over a time scale of a few tens of\n",
       "seconds. However, as a result of the radar's finite beam width, the\n",

       "which is proportional to the horizontal wind speed. Consequently it\n",
       "becomes increasingly difficult to infer turbulence intensities as the\n",
       "wind speed increases.\n",
       "  The radar receiver signal is sampled at 1.0 us intervals following\n",

       "returns is determined by the length of the transmitter pulse (not by\n",
       "the sampling interval), to which the receiver bandwidth must be\n",
       "matched. The range resolution can be increased by using complementary\n",
       "coding. This requires the phase of sub-lengths of the transmitter\n",
       "pulse to be offset by either 0 or 180 degrees according to a set\n",

       "are separated in time by the inter pulse period (of the order of a\n",
       "millisecond). The nature of the samples changes only slowly from pulse\n",
       "to pulse and so coherent integration is applied - for each range gate,\n",
       "groups of consecutive samples are summed together. The number of\n",
       "complex samples in the resulting time series is thus reduced, and the\n",
       "time interval between them is increased, by a factor equal to the\n",
       "number of coherent integrations (typically of the order of a few\n",
       "hundred). The time interval between the new samples (typically of the\n",
       "order of 0.1 s) determines the Nyquist velocity (typically of the\n",

       "unambiguously determined. Decoding must be applied to the coherently\n",

       "  For each Doppler velocity power spectrum, the noise power spectral\n",

       "important under stratiform precipitation conditions in order to\n",
       "separate partially-overlapping clear-air and hydrometeor signal\n",
