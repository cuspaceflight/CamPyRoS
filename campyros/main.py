Notes
-----

Known issues:

- Unsure about the use of "dx" in "scipy.misc.derivative(self.mass_model.mass, time, dx=1)" when calculating mdot
- Possible inconsistency in the definition of the launch site coordinate system, and whether the origin is at alt=0 or alt=launch_site.alt. I haven't thoroughly checked for this inconsistency yet.

Coordinate systems:

- Body (x_b, y_b, z_b)
    - Origin on rocket
    - Rotates with the rocket.

    - y points east and z north at take off (before rail alignment is accounted for) x up.
    - x is along the "long" axis of the rocket.
- Launch site (x_l, y_l, z_l):
    - Origin has the launch site's longitude and latitude, but is at altitude = 0.
    - Rotates with the Earth.

    - z points up (normal to the surface of the Earth).
    - y points East (tangentially to the surface of the Earth).
    - x points South (tangentially to the surface of the Earth).      
- Inertial (x_i, y_i, z_i):
    - Origin at centre of the Earth.
    - Does not rotate.

    - z points to North from the centre of Earth.
    - x aligned with launch site at start .
    - y defined from x and z (so it is a right hand coordinate system).
